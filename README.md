# Picture Perfect Clone Project
The aim of this project was to create a pixel-perfect clone of a web page including all elements, styling, transition effects, and media breakpoints.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Netlfiy (for hosting)

## Original Site
I chose to clone https://www.hipcamp.com/en-US.
Hipcamp serves a slightly different page to each browser, my clone is based on their chrome page in the summer of 2022.
