## Goal
To cement my knowledge of HTML / CSS by creating a pixel-perfect clone of a web page including all elements, styling, transition effects, and media breakpoints.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 - all page elements
- CSS3 - styling and media breakpoints for responsive design
- Netlfiy - hosting

## Original Site
I chose to clone https://www.hipcamp.com/en-US.
Hipcamp serves a slightly different page to each browser, my clone is based on their Chrome page in the summer of 2022.

## What I learned
- This project was a great learning experience. I was able to dive deeply into the options available in CSS and get a better understanding of the pitfalls to avoid.
- For example, because I was working purely from the calculated sizing shown in DevTools I had to hard code many values for this page. When designing in the future I will gravitate towards sizing by percentages and other proportional options when possible. This mixed with FlexBox and Grid would give much nicer resizing / responsive capabilities, and would in turn simplify what is needed in media breakpoints.
- This experience also gave me an appreciation for the ability to programatically generate elements with JavaScript libraries and CSS styling tools, and I look forward to exploring those options further in the future.
